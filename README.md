# Simple_Dungeon_Crawler
This was coded in python and uses the CMU Graphics package within the Replit Online IDE.

To run the game:
1. Go into repl.it and Click "Use Template" to create a new repl with CMU Graphics installed. If you're already in a repl, keep reading!
2. Using a file in Python3, paste the code from my MainGameCode.py text file.
3. Click Run and make sure the Screen is big enough to load the entire game.
4. Have fun and enjoy!

In the game there is:
A White Circle, which is you the player!
Purple Ovals, which is the portal to get to the next level.
Brown Chests, which could be a chest to give you items, or a mimic that could fight you.
Red Circles, which are monsters that you can fight.
Purple Stars, which are bosses that you can fight.

Game Controls:
Use the Arrow Keys to move the white circle, which is you the player.
Move into other objects to interact with them.
When using the console to issue commands, they are case sensitive so enter exactly as they are printed (ex: printed: choose to attack, heal; what you should enter: attack
